<h1 style="text-algin:center;"> # CLi-Application-Nodejs </h1>

This application allows users to perform math-related operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation (power) of two numbers using command line interface.

Application developed using Nodejs 20.0.1 and commander package.

I have added feature module in which I have defined functions to perform operations and exported this module in index.js file.


Instruction to run Application.

1. Please take clone of project from url  https://github.com/Amar9691/CLi-Application-Nodejs.git
2. Run npm install command to install required package for run application.
3. use following command to perform differnt opeations.
   
   1. Operation = >  Addition
      Command  =>    math --operation +  --firstnumber number1  --secondnumber number2
      Here you can use any value for number1 and number 2 arguments
      
   2. Operation = >  Subtraction
      Command  =>    math --operation -  --firstnumber number1  --secondnumber number2
      Here you can use any value for number1 and number 2 arguments
      
   3. Operation = >  Multiplication
      Command  =>    math --operation *  --firstnumber number1  --secondnumber number2
      Here you can use any value for number1 and number 2 arguments
      
   4. Operation = >  Division
      Command  =>    math --operation /  --firstnumber number1  --secondnumber number2
      Here you can use any value for number1 and number 2 arguments
      
   5. Operation = >  Power
      Command  =>    math --operation **  --firstnumber number1  --secondnumber number2
      Here you can use any value for number1 and number 2 arguments
